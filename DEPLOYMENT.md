# Standalone Decent Copy Editor - Deployment Guide

## ✅ What We've Built

I've successfully created a standalone desktop application for editing Decent DAO language files. Here's what you now have:

### 🏗️ Complete Standalone Application
- **Electron-based desktop app** that runs independently
- **Project folder selection** - users choose their Decent project directory
- **File validation** - ensures the selected folder is a valid Decent project
- **Full editing functionality** - same features as the integrated version
- **Cross-platform support** - Windows, macOS, and Linux

### 📁 Project Structure
```
standalone-copy-editor/
├── src/                    # React frontend
├── electron/              # Electron main process
├── dist/                  # Built application (ready to run)
├── release/              # Distribution packages
├── scripts/              # Build utilities
├── package.json          # Dependencies and build config
├── README.md             # User documentation
├── SETUP.md              # Developer setup guide
└── LICENSE               # MIT license
```

## 🚀 How To Distribute This

### Option 1: Simple Distribution (Recommended)
1. **Zip the built application**:
   ```bash
   cd c:\Users\Che Bajandas\decent-app\standalone-copy-editor
   # Create a zip with the entire folder
   ```

2. **Users run it locally**:
   ```bash
   # User downloads and extracts
   cd decent-copy-editor
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

### Option 2: Pre-built Executables
1. **Build platform-specific packages**:
   ```bash
   npm run dist:win    # Creates .exe installer
   npm run dist:mac    # Creates .dmg for macOS
   npm run dist:linux  # Creates .AppImage
   ```

2. **Upload to GitHub releases** or your preferred distribution method

## 📋 User Instructions

### First-Time Setup
1. **Download/clone the copy editor**
2. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Run the application**: `npm start`

### Daily Usage
1. **Launch the app**
2. **Select project folder** - choose your Decent DAO project root
3. **Edit language files** - same interface as before
4. **Save changes** - files are written directly to your project

### Project Requirements
The application looks for this structure:
```
your-decent-project/
├── public/
│   └── locales/
│       └── en/
│           ├── common.json
│           ├── actions.json
│           └── ...other .json files
└── package.json
```

## 🔧 Developer Workflow

### Making Changes
1. **Edit source code** in the `standalone-copy-editor` folder
2. **Test changes**: `npm run dev`
3. **Build for distribution**: `npm run build`

### Creating New Releases
1. **Test thoroughly** with multiple Decent projects
2. **Update version** in package.json
3. **Create distribution packages**:
   ```bash
   npm run dist:win
   npm run dist:mac
   npm run dist:linux
   ```
4. **Upload to releases** with clear install instructions

## 🎯 Benefits of This Approach

### For Your Team
- ✅ **Zero repository pollution** - no copy-editor code in main repo
- ✅ **Optional tool** - developers can choose to use it or not
- ✅ **Version independent** - works with any Decent project version
- ✅ **Easy updates** - just download new version when available

### For Users
- ✅ **Simple installation** - download and run
- ✅ **Works offline** - no server required
- ✅ **Direct file editing** - changes saved to original files
- ✅ **Project flexibility** - can work with multiple projects

### For Maintenance
- ✅ **Simple architecture** - standard Electron + React
- ✅ **No complex deployment** - just file distribution
- ✅ **Easy debugging** - standard web dev tools
- ✅ **Clear separation** - completely independent from main app

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test the current build** by selecting your Decent project
2. **Verify all functionality** works as expected
3. **Package for initial distribution** (zip file method)

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Add application icons
- Implement simple auto-update check
- Add more file format support
- Create better error handling
- Add configuration options

## 📝 Summary

You now have a complete, standalone copy editor that:
- Runs independently of your main repository
- Can be distributed as a simple download
- Provides the same functionality as the integrated version
- Allows team members to opt-in rather than forcing adoption
- Can be updated independently of your main application

The application is ready to use and distribute. Your team members can simply download it, install Node.js dependencies, and start editing language files from any Decent DAO project on their machine.
